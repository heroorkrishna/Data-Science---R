I have a dataset containing family information of married couples, which have around 10 variables & 600+ observations. 
Independent variables are ~ gender, age, years married, children, religion etc.
I have one response variable which is number of extra marital affairs.
 Now, I want to know what all factor influence the chances of extra marital affair.
Since extra marital affair is a binary variable (either a person will have or not), 
so we can fit logistic regression model here to predict the probability of extra marital affair.
