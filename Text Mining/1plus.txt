I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus. Totally waste product...

"Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.I ordered it on 16th May 12PM and it got delivered by 17th May 10AMAnd so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. <U+0001F60D>

"No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.
